Thanks. 
I ran the tool on a sentence of mine and it worked well. 
Found a bunch of URLs. 
Showed that I'm a academic I guess. 
Didn't look at it in more detail. 
But the I ran it again with a list of short phrases and it didn't work. 
It went through the motions but never found more than one page of results and then the output file was empty. 
Anyway I'm not sure if Google blocked me or something else.
At least some return some hits if done manually. 
Maybe it's how I formatted the test file? 
As a series of strings separated by new lines?
